# RoadToAviao - Game 

## Description
 
 We were challenged to create a game applying all technologies we had learned the previous week at <Acadeia de Código_>,in Java and using Simple Graphics library with a deadline of 10 nights. It was a group
 project with 5 other students.

## Idea

the idea came that we wanted to bring something classic from our childhoods and add features that would remind us of our daily lives at the <Academia de Código_>. So we had the idea to create a 2D Mario kart game with obstacles and characters from the Academy.
